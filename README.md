# 🌍 Pepe the Frog's Travel Blog 🌍

## 🎉 Welcome to Pepe's World!

Hop on board and join Pepe the Frog 🐸 on an exhilarating journey to the most whimsical places you could ever imagine! From the laughter-filled streets of Meep City to the bouncy grounds of Yoshi's Island, and not forgetting the tasty adventures in Papa's Pizzeria, this website is your ticket 🎟️ to a world where imagination knows no bounds. 

## 📚 What We'll Learn

Building Pepe's travel blog isn't just about exploring these magical places; it's also about embarking on an adventure into the world of HTML. Here’s a peek at what treasures you'll uncover:

### The Basics of HTML

- **Doctype and HTML Structure**: We'll start our journey by setting up our HTML document properly with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and learning about the basic structure of an HTML document.

### The Head

- **Meta Tags**: Discover how to use meta tags to ensure your website looks good on all devices and how to set your website's character encoding for displaying text correctly.
- **Title Tag**: Learn how to give your webpage a title that appears in the browser tab with the `title` tag.

### Crafting The Body

#### Exploring New Places

- **Divisions (`<div>`)**: Use `div` tags to organize your content into sections, just like packing different items into compartments of your suitcase. 🧳
- **Headings and Paragraphs (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`)**: Learn how to use headings to title different sections of your blog and paragraphs to tell tales of your adventures.

#### Describing Adventures

- **Emphasis (`<em>`)**: Add emphasis to the names of magical places with the `em` tag, making them stand out.
- **Underline (`<u>`)**: Discover how to underline text to highlight important sections like "About the Place" and "Things to Do".

#### Adding Images

- **Image Tag (`<img>`)**: Bring your stories to life by adding images of each fantastic location. Learn about the `src`, `width`, and `alt` attributes to display pictures perfectly and describe them for screen readers.

#### Lists of Fun Activities

- **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)**: Compile lists of fun things to do in each place with `ul` and `li` tags, just like making a checklist of all the exciting activities awaiting you.
